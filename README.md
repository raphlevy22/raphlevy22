- 👋 Hi I’m Raphael LEVY currently working at Accuracy and wrapping up my Master in Big Data and Business Analytics at ESCP Business School in Paris.
- 👀 I’m passionate about leveraging data and AI for business purposes and have a key interest in NLP and Sports Analytics topics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and putting into practice NLP features and more precisely working on PDF data extraction and bringing insights out of PDF visually. All of that without using any LLM.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of projects but I do have a preference for sports analytics and NLP-related topics.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me at raphael.levy@edu.escp.eu
